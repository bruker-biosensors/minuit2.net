# minuit2.net 

# Prequisites
## Recompiling of the C++ layer
The minuit code is wrapped using swig(https://www.swig.org/).

To recompile the wrapper, you will need cmake and swig.

This package uses the standalone minuit2 available here https://github.com/GooFit/Minuit2
which will be downloaded as part of the cmake build procedure.
